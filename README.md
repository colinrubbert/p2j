## Path to Junior

A resource for pursuing a new path in life, the path to becoming a junior developer.

#### Areas of focus

* Included in this will be resources for people interested in pursuing web developer, software development, UI/UX design, and other areas of development.

* There will be a focus on reviews and information for educational resources; coding bootcamps, accelerated programs, self-taught & self-paced online resources.

* In tandem with educational resources there will be reviews and information on apprenticeships. This will be there to help easily locate an apprenticeship with companies that are interested in help build up people's coding abilities and willing to take the time to invest in someone or their organization to succeed.

* There will also be a resource section specifically dedicated to free and readily available resources for burgeoning developers and designers. Items like coding tutorials, design resources (color palettes, stock photography, font resources, etc), marketing, business development, freelance resources, and much more.

* The final piece will be a job board that specifically caters to entry level to junior developers. Employers will be able to add a job posting in multiple categories; apprenticeship, internship (current college student will NOT be a pre-requisite), entry-level (0-1 years experience), junior positions (1-2 years experience).

This project will be updated regularly to reflect new information, reviews, and jobs. If you are interested in getting in contact with myself and submit new entries or information please contact _colinrubbert@gmail.com_.
