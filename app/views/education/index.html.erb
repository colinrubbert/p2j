      The Firehose Project is an immersive online apprenticeship that aims to help you launch your idea into a real web application. Students will start coding on day one, and will work 1-on-1 with an experienced mentor to build their coding skills. Students have access to a Q&amp;A forum, and technical office hours with real web developers. Graduates will build advanced features and work with APIs, user authentication, payment processing, automated notification emails, video streaming, image uploading, geolocation, and user dashboards. Classes start each Monday and the Firehose Project will also help convince your employer to sponsor the apprenticeship.
